            "message": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand at an accelerated rate, the medical system is under significant strain, both from a staffing and resource perspective. Facilities have limited beds, equipment, and staff on hand to triage patients and there is no way to effectively communicate, inventory and ease the burden in overtaxed areas.\r\n\r\nThe Traction Thrive Critical Care Resource Management application enables hospitals and healthcare practitioners to more accurately track and distribute critical medical staff and resources to meet the immediate needs of COVID-19 response teams.\r\n\r\nLearn more at [https://tractionondemand.com/traction-thrive/](https://tractionondemand.com/traction-thrive/)\r\n\r\nInstallation Guide available on Salesforce AppExchange: [https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FMvlIUAT](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FMvlIUAT)\r\n\r\nOpen source public GitHub repository: [https://github.com/SFDO-Community/TractionThrive](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/TractionThrive)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFDO-Community/TractionThrive/master/assets/traction_thrive_logo-medium.png)",
